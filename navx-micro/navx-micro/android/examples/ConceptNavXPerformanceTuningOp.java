/**
 * navX-Micro Performance Tuning Op
 *
 * This opmode provides insight into the peformance of the communication
 * with the navX-Model sensor over the I2C bus via the Core Device Interface
 * Module.  Since the Android operating system is not a real-time
 * operating system, and since communication w/the navX-Model sensor is
 * occurring over a wifi-direct network which can be prone to interference,
 * the actual performance (update rate) achieved may be less than
 * one might expect.
 *
 * Since the navX-Model devices integrate sensor data onboard, to achieve
 * the best performance for device control methods like a PID controller
 * that work best with constant-time updates, the strategy is to:
 *
 * 1) Configure the navX-Model device to a high update rate (e.g., 50Hz)
 * 2) Using this performance-tuning Op-Mode (with all other
 * sensors connected, just as your robot will be configured for normal
 * use) observe the "effective" update rate, and the number of missed
 * samples over the last minute.
 * 3) Lower the navX-Model device update rate until the number of missed
 * samples over the last minute reaches zero.
