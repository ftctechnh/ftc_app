/** \mainpage ROBOTC Driver Suite
*
* \author Xander Soldaat
*
* \section intro Introduction
* The aim of this project is to create an easy to use suite of drivers for ROBOTC.
* ROBOTC supports many of the devices listed below. However, these built-in drivers
* are often limited to a subset of the functionality that some of these sensors have
* to offer. The drivers in this suite give you access to all of this functionality.
* Care has been taken to document the use of these functions.
*
* For (almost) every driver there is at least one example file that shows you how to
* use the API for that particular driver.
*
* Use the links on the left to navigate between the various drivers and test programs.
