/**
 * This Android Studio module, YourCodeHere, and it's associated java package
 * org.usfirst.ftc.exampleteam.yourcodehere, are intended to provide an example
 * of the basic skeleton of a recommended source code structure you can use to
 * get your team going with its own code.
 *
 * <p>Following common source-code-management best practices, your code
 * best lives in a module and package that is entirely outside the modules and packages
 * of the libraries on which your code depends (here, FtcRobotController and
 * SwerveRoboticsLibrary). This helps support the easier integration of updates to those
 * libraries into your code as time goes on.</p>
 *
 * <p>You can either edit your code here, in the YourCodeHere module, or set up a
 * sibling module for your code, though the former might be easier to get going.</p>
