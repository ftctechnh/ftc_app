# Module core

Core functionality and API of Road Runner.

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner

Common types used to represent robot state, paths, trajectories, etc.

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner.control

Controllers for generic control tasks including tracking motion profiles (not limited to 2D paths or trajectories).

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner.drive

Drive-specific interfaces that provide functionality for setting robot velocities and using positional feedback for 
localization.

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner.followers

A collection of path and trajectory followers for various drive types.

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner.path

Type hierarchy for representing 2D holonomic robot paths (x, y, and heading components). 

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner.path.heading

A set of interpolators that describe how the robot's heading changes along a path.

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner.profile

Generic motion profiling featuring either dynamic constraints or jerk limiting.

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner.trajectory

Types for representing 2D robot trajectories, including time parametrizations of paths.

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner.trajectory.constraints

Specific constraints for trajectories and different drive types.

# Package com.acmerobotics.roadrunner.util

Miscellaneous utilities.
