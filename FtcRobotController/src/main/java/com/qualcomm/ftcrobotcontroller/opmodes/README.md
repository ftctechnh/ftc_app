#OpModes
The following are the current programs registered on our robot (please keep updated):
* "DucksTeleOp"
* "DucksAutonomous"

The current updated TeleOp program is "DucksTeleOp". 
The autonomous program is named "DucksAtonomous."
AutonomousCommands and TeleOpCommands contain methods for autonomous and teleop which control certain functions of the robot. DucksAtonomous/TeleOp extend these files respectively, which extend Opmode or LinearOpMode.
