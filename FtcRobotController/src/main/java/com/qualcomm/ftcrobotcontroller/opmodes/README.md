#OpModes
The following are the current programs registered on our robot (please keep updated):
* "MotorMoveAutonomouse"
* "DucksTeleOp"
* "DucksAtonomous"

The current updated TeleOp program is "DucksTeleOp". "MotorMove" is outdated since it has old motor values and directions, and is using LinearOpMode instead of OpMode.
The autonomous program should be named "DucksAutonomous" for organizational sake.
