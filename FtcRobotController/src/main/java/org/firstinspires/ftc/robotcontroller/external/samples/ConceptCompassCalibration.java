/**
 * This file illustrates the concept of calibrating a MR Compass
 * It uses the common Pushbot hardware class to define the drive on the robot.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 *   This code assumes there is a compass configured with the name "compass"
 *
 *   This code will put the compass into calibration mode, wait three seconds and then attempt
 *   to rotate two full turns clockwise.  This will allow the compass to do a magnetic calibration.
 *
 *   Once compete, the program will put the compass back into measurement mode and check to see if the
 *   calibration was successful.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
