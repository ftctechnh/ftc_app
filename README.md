# FIRST Team 5893, Direct Current

Welcome to our team code repository. Here you will find all of the code we use,
from previous and current competition code to test code and prototypes.

For our changelog, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Team5893/TeamCode/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Our code is for the [FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/) is a non-profit organization that promotes the ideas of STEM and Gracious Professionalism- robotics competitions are a medium to carry forth these ideas.

### Core Package
We strive to write code that is structured, clean, accessible, and powerful. That is why we created the Core package- a package that can help you structure your own code and give it the power that every team's code needs. You can read more about the Core package in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Team5893/TeamCode/wiki). We are continuing to develop the Core Package to give it as much functionality and power as possible- **releases are not stable**. Please understand that, while the package is usable in its current state, the project is in a beta stage. 

### OpenCV
This project uses OpenCV- you can find out more [here](https://opencv.org/). Use of OpenCV is assisted by a helper app called [AndroidCV](https://github.com/FusionForScience/AndroidCV).

### Seasonal Code
All of our season's code, current and old, will be available. All of our code is free for use. See the [license](https://github.com/Team5893/TeamCode/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for more information.
