# Powerstackers FTC Team 5029

This is the Powerstackers' personal fork of the FTC robot control app, for use with our robots that we will build this season. For information, contact us at powerstackers@gmail.com.

More to come later. :)

To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.
Use Android Studio to open the folder as an "existing Android Studio project".
