# Powerstackers FTC Team 5029

This is the Powerstackers' personal fork of the FTC robot control app, for use with our robots that we will build this season. For information, contact us at powerstackers@gmail.com.

This repository contains code taken from the following sources:
* [Swerve Robotics FTC Library](https://github.com/SwerveRobotics/ftc_app)
* [LASA Robotics FTC Vision](https://github.com/lasarobotics/FTCVision)

To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.
Use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

## Documentation
Documentation for the FTC SDK are included with this repository.  There is a subfolder called "doc" which contains several subfolders:

 * The folder "apk" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.
 * The folder "javadoc" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK.
 * The folder "tutorial" contains PDF files that help teach the basics of using the FTC SDK.
