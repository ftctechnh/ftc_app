A tutorial on working with the FTC SDK, can be found under the 'docs/tutorial' directory. Everyone should step through this tutorial before beginning any actual robot programming. For any questions, see Coach Tarbox.

Robot Programming Process
---

__Beginning of Class__
- Sign in to GitHub Desktop with your username and password.
- Checkout any previous branch that you were working on (if any), otherwise checkout the 'master' branch.
- If you need something to work on, please check the 'Issues' list for items that might need to be worked on still. Make sure you talk to the person who created the issue to make sure they aren't also working on it.
- If there isn't anything specific to work on, please see Coach Tarbox or Mrs. Barnes.
- Pull the latest changes from master.
- Begin work.

__During Class__
- If you complete a piece of work (including testing on the robot if possible), commit and push the changes to your branch.
- Create a Pull Request (PR), comparing your branch to the latest in 'master'.
- Tag the team and Coach Tarbox for a code review.
- Fix any issues identified by the code review and tag the reviewer(s) to re-review.

__End of Class__
- Add any known issues to the 'Issues' list.
- Sign out of GitHub Desktop.


Your First Programming Task
---
To ensure that everyone is familiar with the code commit / review process, each member of the team should walk through making a very simple change, sending it for review, and seeing it committed to our master branch.

- Checkout the latest 'master' branch.
- Create a new branch titled 'Team-Members-your initials'.
- Add your name to the list of team members in the 'Team-Members.txt' file.
- Commit and push your branch.
- Create a Pull Request (PR) and tag the team and Coach Tarbox to review.
- Watch for your changes to get pushed through to 'master'.
