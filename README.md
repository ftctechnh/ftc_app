## Downloading the Project
It is important to note that this repository is large and can take a long time and use a lot of space to download. If you would like to save time and space, there are some options that you can choose to download only the most current version of the Android project folder:

* If you are a git user, *FIRST* recommends that you use the --depth command line argument to only clone the most current version of the repository:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app.git</p>

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").
