# ftc_app
FTC Android Studio project to create FTC Robot Controller app.

This is the FTC SDK that can be used to create an FTC Robot Controller app, with custom op modes.
The FTC Robot Controller app is designed to work in conjunction with the FTC Driver Station app.
The FTC Driver Station app is available through Google Play.

To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.
Use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").


## How to use Git and GitHub

Do not submit a *pull request* to this repository unless you actually intend to submit an improvement to the underlying code for all teams! You probably mean instead to do a *merge* with the "upstream" repository (this one), which will add the newest SDK updates to your team's private repository.

To do this, first merge the new changes into your `master` branch like this: (If there are any merge conflicts, Git will let you know how to resolve them.)

    git pull https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app master

To make this easier, you might want to assign https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app as a remote.

    # Run once
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app
    # Now all you have to type is this:
    git pull upstream master

After you finish merging everything and resolving any conflicts if necessary, you'll need to push it back up to your own repository.

    # If you haven't done so already, you should assign your GitHub repository as a remote.
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY
    # Then just push the code to the remote.
    git push origin master

## Documentation

Documentation for the FTC SDK are included with this repository.  There is a subfolder called "doc" which contains several subfolders:

 * The folder "apk" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.
 * The folder "javadoc" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK.
 * The folder "tutorial" contains PDF files that help teach the basics of using the FTC SDK.

**************************************************************************************

Release 15.11.04.001

 * Added Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.
  - The GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor.

  - Users can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes).
  - Example MRGyroTest.java op mode included.
 * Improved error messages
  - More descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code.
 * Updated DcMotor API
 * Enable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress
 * Fix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes.
 * USB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages.
  - Fix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data.
  - Fix USB initializtion race condition.
  - Better error reporting during FTDI open.
  - More explicit messages during USB failures.
  - Fixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called.
 * Fixed timer UI issue
 * Fixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration).
 * Fixed race condition in EventLoopManager.

**************************************************************************************

In this latest version of the FTC SDK (20150803_001) the following changes should be noted:

 * New user interfaces for FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.
 * An init() method is added to the OpMode class.
   - For this release, init() is triggered right before the start() method.
   - Eventually, the init() method will be triggered when the user presses an "INIT" button on driver station.
   - The init() and loop() methods are now required (i.e., need to be overridden in the user's op mode).
   - The start() and stop() methods are optional.
 * A new LinearOpMode class is introduced.
   - Teams can use the LinearOpMode mode to create a linear (not event driven) program model.
   - Teams can use blocking statements like Thread.sleep() within a linear op mode.
 * The API for the Legacy Module and Core Device Interface Module have been updated.
   - Support for encoders with the Legacy Module is now working.
 * The hardware loop has been updated for better performance.
