# Release Information
**************************************************************************************

Version 4.0 (released on 18.09.12)

Changes include:
 * Initial support for UVC compatible cameras 
    - If UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number.
    - If UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected.
    - Calibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details).
    - User can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface.
    - UVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus.
         + This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.
	 + This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.
	 + FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.
    - Updated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam.    

 * Support for improved motor control.
    - REV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control.
    - FTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward).
    - FTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks.
    - Deprecated older PID-related methods and variables.
    - REV's 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor.

 * Wireless
    - Added 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it.
        + Tested with Moto G5 and E4 phones.
	+ Also tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8.

* Improved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app
    - Changes to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app).
    - User no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub's firmware.
        + If user is updating an Expansion Hub's firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs.
	+ The user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub's firmware.
	+ The user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection.
    - If an Expansion Hub accidentally gets "bricked" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus.
        + Robot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.
	+ Robot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt.
 
 * Resiliency
    - FTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater.
        + When enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn't communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection.
	+ If the Hub hasn't heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection.
	+ This action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions.
    - Various fixes to improve reliability of FTC software.
     
 * Blocks
    - Fixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java.
    - Support for USB connected UVC webcams.
    - Refactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets.
    - Added programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control.
    - Added formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value.
    - Support to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller.
    - Fixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature.
    - Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.
    - Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.
    - Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device).
    - Added blocks for DcMotorEx methods.
        + These are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware.
	+ The REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods.
	+ Enhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc..

 * Modest Improvements in Logging
    - Decrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements.
    - Removed non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible).
    - Introduced a "Match Logging" feature.
        + Under "Settings" a user can enable/disable this feature (it's disabled by default).
	+ If enabled, user provides a "Match Number" through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen).
	    * The Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run.
	    * Match log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller.
	    * Once an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared.
	    * This is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run.
 
 * New Devices
    - Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.
    - Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor.
    - Added configuration option for REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor.

    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets.
    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor.
    - Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller.
    - Re-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to "TeleOp" instead of "Autonomous".
    
Known issues:
 * Initial support for UVC compatible cameras
    - UVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus.
        + This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub.
	+ This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller.
	+ FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers.
    - There might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller.

 * Wireless
    - When user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled.
        + Tech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release.
	+ Issue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release).
    - Wireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections.

 * Miscellaneous
    - The blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file.
        + User has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work.

**************************************************************************************

Version 3.2 (built on 17.08.02)

This version of the software introduces the "OnBot Java" Development Tool.  Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.

The OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller.  Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended).  Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.  

The OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.



Changes with version 3.2 include:
 * Enhanced web-based development tools
    - Introduction of OnBot Java Development Tool.
    - Web-based programming and management features are "always on" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode).

     - Access via *this* keyword
     - Access via *super* keyword
     - Members of the super cloass, not overridden by the class
     - Any methods provided in the current class
     - Inner classes
     - Can't handle casted objects
     - Any objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression

**************************************************************************************

Version 3.10 (built on 17.05.09)

This version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub.  This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency.  If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.

Also note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.

Changes include:
 * Blocks changes
    - Added VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks.
    - Added optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking.
    - Added atan2 block to the math category.
    - Added useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block.  If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode.
 * Incorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions).

**************************************************************************************

Additional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)

In addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled "Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)"), version 3.00 has the following important changes:

1. Version 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol).  If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol.
2. Version 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class.  If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods.  Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration.
3. Version 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors.  We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future.

**************************************************************************************

Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)

**************************************************************************************

Version 2.00 (released on 16.08.19)
 * This is the new release for the upcoming 2016-2017 FIRST Tech Challenge Season.
 * Channel change is enabled in the FTC Robot Controller app for Moto G 2nd and 3rd Gen phones.
 * Users can now use annotations to register/disable their Op Modes.
 * Changes in the Android SDK, JDK and build tool requirements (minsdk=19, java 1.7, build tools 23.0.3).
 * Standardized units in analog input.
 * Cleaned up code for existing analog sensor classes.
 * setChannelMode and getChannelMode were REMOVED from the DcMotorController class.  This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller.
 * setMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class.  
 * ContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK.
 * Range.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers.
 * Some changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map.
 * Users can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero.
 * Prototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller.  Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller.
 * Users can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app.
 * Android Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow).
 * Vuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK.  Users can use sample vision targets to get localization information on a standard FTC field.
 * Project structure has been reorganized so that there is now a TeamCode package that users can use to place their local/custom Op Modes into this package.
 * Inspection function has been integrated into the FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps (Thanks Team HazMat… 9277 & 10650!).
 * Audio cues have been incorporated into FTC SDK.
 * Swap mechanism added to FTC Robot Controller configuration activity.  For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices).
 * Fix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily.  For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller.  You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module.
 * Improvements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system.
 * For LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station.  This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time.
 * The Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based.  If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type.
 * The logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented.
 * Fix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users.

**************************************************************************************

Release 16.07.08

 * For the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x.



**************************************************************************************

Release 16.03.30

 * For the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component.
 * Some changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services.
 * A change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor.
 * Javadoc improved/updated.

**************************************************************************************

Release 16.03.09

 * Changes made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!)
    - waitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated.
    - runOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread.
    - loop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread.
    - Methods are synchronous.
    - For example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete.
    - For legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device.
 * Changes made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event.
 * Changes made to make code thread safe.
 * Debug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example).
 * Firmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged.
 * Changes made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness.
 * Added support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers.
 * Changes made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes.
    - A LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete.  User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station.
    - If an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread.
 * Driver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery).
 * Driver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage).
 * javadoc improved (edits and additional classes).
 * Added app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps.
 * Display local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity.
 * Added I2cDeviceSynchImpl.
 * Added I2cDeviceSync interface.
 * Added seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity.
 * Added getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice.
 * Added missing clearI2cPortActionFlag.
 * Added code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown.
 * Fix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times.
 * Added the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro.

**************************************************************************************

Release 16.02.09

 * Improved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface.
 * Improved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and “self-healing” to USB disconnects:
    - If user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up.
    - When running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s).
    - If a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module.
    - Warning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that’s missing plus its USB serial number).   
 * Code changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode.
 * NXT light sensor output is now properly scaled.  Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes.
 * On DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver.
 * Robot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps.
 * Incorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don’t use the “<TEAM NUMBER>-“ format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices.
 * Updated text in License file.
 * Fixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString().
 * Fixed issue on with a blank (“”) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing.
 * Made a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC.
 * Improved javadoc generation.
 * Modified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future.
