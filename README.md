# Omegas Module
## Introduction

Welcome!

This module, Omegas, is the place where FTC 6504 (the Omegas) write and paste the code for our team's robot controller app. This module contains templates for older robots and library usage, as well as helper classes like `HardwareOmegas` and `OmegasBeacon`, and useful opmodes, like `OmegasVision` and `OmegasLinear`.
