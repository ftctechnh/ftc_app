# Powerstackers FTC Team 5029
This is the Powerstackers' personal fork of the FTC robot control app, for use with our robots that we will build this season. For information, contact us at powerstackers@gmail.com.

This repository contains code taken from the following sources:
* [Swerve Robotics FTC Library](https://github.com/SwerveRobotics/ftc_app)
* [LASA Robotics FTC Vision](https://github.com/lasarobotics/FTCVision)

To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.
Use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

## Documentation
Documentation for the FTC SDK are included with this repository.  There is a subfolder called "doc" which contains several subfolders:

 * The folder "apk" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.
 * The folder "javadoc" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK.
 * The folder "tutorial" contains PDF files that help teach the basics of using the FTC SDK.

For technical questions regarding the SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum:

**************************************************************************************

Release 16.01.04

 * Updated compileSdkVersion for apps
 * Prevent Wifi from entering power saving mode
 * removed unused import from driver station
 * Corrrected "Dead zone" joystick code.
 * LED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null
 * apps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch
 * Fix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error
 * User telemetry output is sorted.
 * added formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs
 * code modified to allow for a long list of op mode names.
 * changes to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket
 * Fix for "missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station" error
 * fix for "fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread).
 * added some log statements for thread life cycle.
 * moved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness
 * changes made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods.
 * changes to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters.
 * fix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard.
 * updated FTDI driver
 * made ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public.
 * fixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor
 * moved specific hardware implmentations into their own package.
 * moved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library.
 * changed LICENSE file to new BSD version.
 * fixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices.
 * methods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized.
 * corrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion.
 * corrected "back" button keycode.
 * the notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public).


**************************************************************************************

Release 15.11.04.001

 * Added Support for Modern Robotics Gyro.
  - The GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor.
  - Users can access heading data (about Z axis)
  - Users can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes).
  - Example MRGyroTest.java op mode included.
 * Improved error messages
  - More descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code.
 * Updated DcMotor API
 * Enable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress
 * Fix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes.
 * USB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages.
  - Fix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data.
  - Fix USB initializtion race condition.
  - Better error reporting during FTDI open.
  - More explicit messages during USB failures.
  - Fixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called.
 * Fixed timer UI issue
 * Fixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration).
 * Fixed race condition in EventLoopManager.
 * Fix to keep references stable when updating gamepad.
 * For legacy Matrix motor/servo controllers removed necessity of appending "Motor" and "Servo" to controller names.
 * Updated HT color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbLegacyModule class.
 * Updated MR color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbDeviceInterfaceModule class.
 * Correctly handle I2C Address change in all color sensors
 * Updated/cleaned up op modes.
  - Updated comments in LinearI2cAddressChange.java example op mode.
  - Replaced the calls to "setChannelMode" with "setMode" (to match the new of the DcMotor  method).
  - Removed K9AutoTime.java op mode.
  - Added MRGyroTest.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Gyro Sensor).
  - Added MRRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Color Sensor).
  - Added HTRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use HT legacy color sensor).
  - Added MatrixControllerDemo.java (demonstrates how to use legacy Matrix controller).
 * Updated javadoc documentation.
 * Updated release .apk files for Robot Controller and Driver Station apps.
