# TEAM SBEV's BEAUTIFUL GITHUB REPOSITORY

This is where we share code.
If you aren't a contributor, ask me and I'll invite you.

# Installation

If you have any issues with the install process, ask me and I'll help as best I can.
## Git
This project is best installed using git. Most non-windows (a.k.a. sane) users should have git preinstalled.
### Windows
If you use Windows (why?), and don't have git, visit the following website:
https://git-scm.com/download/win

## Installation Process
Please clone the repo to whatever folder you like.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LonelyKirbyMain/ftc_app.git
```
Next open Android Studio and select "Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc. )."
Navigate to the project folder and import.

Please create your own branch with:
```bash
git checkout -b [branch_name (i.e. "tom")]
git push origin [branch_name]
```
This way you have a safe place to make changes and put them on the github without fucking everything up.

# Coding
All code you will be writing is in `Teamcode/src/main/java/org.firstinspires.teamcode.` Feel free to take a look at our code, the javadocs, and the examples located in `FtcRobotController/java/org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller/external.samples`. If you're still stuck, ask me (Tom) or any of the other coders.

## Style
Use `camelCase` for variables; `PascalCase` for classes; `UPPER_CASE` for constants. For more, see [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-135099.html).
