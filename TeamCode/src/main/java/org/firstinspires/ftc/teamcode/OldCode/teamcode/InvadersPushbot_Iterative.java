/**
 * This file provides Telop driving for the IfSpace Invaders 2015/16 Pushbot robot.
 * The code is structured as an Iterative OpMode
 *
 * This OpMode uses the common Pushbot hardware class to define the devices on the robot.
 * Most device access is managed through the HardwarePushbot class.  A touch sensor was added to
 * limit our robot arm range of motion and is manually connected to the robot during init().
 *
 * This particular OpMode provides single-thumb navigation of PushBot using the left-thumbstick.
 * It raises and lowers the claw using the right-thumbstick.
 * It also opens and closes the claws slowly using the left and right Trigger buttons.
 *
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
