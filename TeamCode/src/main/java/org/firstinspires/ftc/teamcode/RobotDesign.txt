// ROBOT DRIVE
// Robot has 4 mechanum wheels, driven by independent motors.
// reference the slide show that is at maxwellscott922@gmail.com
//All the Y vectors are just y/-y because those are the standard vectors for forward* and backward**.
// The vectors for x is just the standard ones for left*** and right****.
//Turn is well, the vectors*****/ wheel values to turn. Then, all the matrixes add together.
//The scsling program takes any numbers above one and makes them one.
//So if any numbers end up being more than one, they go back down to one.
//
//How did we get there?
//WEll, we found some equations online.
//Those equations didn’t work so we subtracted pi/4 instead of adding pi/4.
//Then, We realized that polar coordinates, sines and vectors were too much so, we simplified it.
//So, instead of converting cartesian to polar coordinates, we decided to add the vectors directly  so we don't have to deal with the law of sines and cartesian coordinates.
//WE just brought the scaling over from the other, more complicated drive class. The plan is to change it right now…
//
//What I learned
//I learned that in coding, don’t use “brute force” with lots of if statements and straight commands.
//I also learned that there are other types of coordinates than x and y.

//
// ROBOT ARM
// Robot has arm mechanism that can lift similar to a forklift (up/down)
// left/right adjustments for the robot arm must be made by driving the robot side-to-side
//
// ROBOT CLAW
// Robot had claw mechanism on the ARM that can grasp glyphs (open/close)
//
// ROBOT POLE
// Robot has a fishing pole mechanism for delivering the icon. Pole can extend/retract
// Pole mechanism has a hinge at the robot end and can raise/lower it's tip.
//
// ROBOT VUE
// Robot uses the on-phone camera to detect and decode Vuemarks
//
// ROBOT NAV
// Robot uses the on-phone camera to determine it's absolute position on the field
