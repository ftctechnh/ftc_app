## New programmer, who dis?

Looking for the team code for Dragons 1.0 (6128) or Dragons 2.0 (7935)? Well this is wheres its at. 
There are also test programs included in the `Tests` folder. I would highly recommend adding those along with your respective teams code.

## How do I add and use this code?

1. Install [android studios](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). This can be found by clicking the link provided, or just searching for it on google
2. Once android studios is installed and configured, go to the [ftc_app repository](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app) and download that.
3. Once downloaded, open the project in android studios
4. Locate the teamcode directory, usually under `TeamCode/java/org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode`
5. Download the respective code from this page, and copy it into the team code directory

## Im still stuck!

Consider reading the [documentation](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/android-studio-tutorial.pdf) for setting up android studios
