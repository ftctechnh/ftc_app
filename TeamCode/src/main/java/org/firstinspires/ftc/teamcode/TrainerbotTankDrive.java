/**
 * This file provides basic Teleop driving for a Trainerbot. It is modified and simplified
 * from the FtcRobotController external sample PushbotTeleopTankIterative. The code is structured
 * as an Iterative OpMode. The arm and claw operation in the sample is not implemented here.
 *
 * Tank drive means the gamepad left stick controls the left motor, and the right stick controls
 * the right motor.
 *
 * This OpMode uses the Trainerbot hardware class to define the devices on the robot.
 * All device access is managed through the Trainerbot class.
