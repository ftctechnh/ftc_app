There are two kinds of Tests in this folder:
1. Research and Development
2. Troubleshoot/Reusable

1. These are the kind of programs we use to see if new ways of programming or if new electronics we're using
are viable. It's more of the MAJOR STUFF. Like switching from modern robotics to REV.
Once we finish testing, we either document what we learned and/or copy over the program to our in progress folders

2. These are programs that we can use again and again just to see what's breaking down on our robot, or to see how
a new sensor works.
