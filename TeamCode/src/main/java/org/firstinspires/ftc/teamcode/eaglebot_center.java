/**
 * This file illustrates the concept of driving a path based on time.
 * It uses the common Pushbot hardware class to define the drive on the robot.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * The code assumes that you do NOT have encoders on the wheels,
 *   otherwise you would use: PushbotAutoDriveByEncoder;
 *
 *   The desired path in this example is:
 *   - Drive forward for 3 seconds
 *   - Spin right for 1.3 seconds
 *   - Drive Backwards for 1 Second
 *   - Stop and close the claw.
 *
 *  The code is written in a simple form with no optimizations.
 *  However, there are several ways that this type of sequence could be streamlined,
 *
 * Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
