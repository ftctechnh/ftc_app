    How am I allowed to use your content?
    Last Updated: Aug 11, 2016 01:51PM EDT
    Our content may be used for nearly any project, commercial or otherwise, including feature
    films, broadcast, commercial, industrial, educational video, print projects, multimedia, 
    games, and the internet, so long as substantial value is added to the content. (For example, 
    incorporating an audio clip into a commercial qualifies, while reposting our audio clip on 
    YouTube with no modification or no visual component does not.) Once you download a file it is 
    yours to keep and use forever, royalty-	free, even if you change your subscription or cancel 
    your account.
