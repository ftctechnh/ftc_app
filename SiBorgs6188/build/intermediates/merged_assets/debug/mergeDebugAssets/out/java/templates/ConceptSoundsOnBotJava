/**
 * This file demonstrates how to play simple sounds on both the RC and DS phones.
 * It illustrates how to play sound files that have been copied to the RC Phone
 * This technique is best suited for use with OnBotJava since it does not require the app to be modified.
 *
 * Operation:
 *
 * Gamepad X & B buttons are used to trigger sounds in this example, but any event can be used.
 * Note: Time should be allowed for sounds to complete before playing other sounds.
 *
 *  To play a new sound, you will need to copy the .wav files to the phone, and then provide the full path to them as part of your OpMode.
 *  This is done in this sample for the two sound files.  silver.wav and gold.wav
 *
 *  You can put the files in a variety of soundPaths, but we recommend you put them in the /FIRST/blocks/sounds folder.
 *  Your OpModes will have guaranteed access to this folder, and you can transfer files into this folder using the BLOCKS web page.
 *  --  There is a link called "sounds" on the right hand side of the color bar on the BLOCKS page that can be used to send sound files to this folder by default.
 *  Or you can use Windows File Manager, or ADB to transfer the sound files
 *
 *  To get full use of THIS sample, you will need to copy two sound file called silver.wav and gold.wav to /FIRST/blocks/sounds on the RC phone.
 *  They can be located here:
 *      https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/tree/master/FtcRobotController/src/main/res/raw/gold.wav
 *      https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/tree/master/FtcRobotController/src/main/res/raw/silver.wav
